# ProcurementFraudDetection
## Problem :
Government procurement processes are vulnerable to fraud, resulting in significant financial losses and inefficiencies. Develop a program that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of fraudulent procurement contracts based on historical data. 

## Solution Approach:
Using Java to develop this solution, leveraging the Weka machine learning library. The steps include:

- Data Collection: Gather historical procurement contract data, including features such as vendor name, contract value, contract duration, past performance, etc.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data for training.
- Model Training: Train a Weka model to predict fraudulent contracts.
- Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the likelihood of fraud in new procurement contracts.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance and accuracy.

J48 algorithm is one of the most widely used machine learning algorithms to examine the data categorically and continuously. The C4.5 algorithm (J48) is mostly used among many fields for classifying data for example interpreting the clinical data for the diagnosis of coronary heart disease, classifying E-governance data, and many more.


we used class DenseInstance
Class for handling an instance. All values (numeric, date, nominal, string or relational) are internally stored as floating-point numbers. If an attribute is nominal (or a string or relational), the stored value is the index of the corresponding nominal (or string or relational) value in the attribute's definition. We have chosen this approach in favor of a more elegant object-oriented approach because it is much faster.
